# Square Onboarding Project

The application provides a simple UI using go http/template package and bootstrap where a seller can sign in via the Square Oauth api and view a list of customers and a list of gift cards and create/activate/deactivate a gift card and send it to a customer. 
This application is developed and tested in a sandbox environment and not tested in a production environment.
